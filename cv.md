### About Myself:

I'm 22 years old, and I decided that it's time for a change in my life, so I want to learn programming because I want to become a real bearded man with reindeer on his sweater (and a frontend developer).

I like programming, solving interesting problems and drinking a lot of coffee. I hope that my efforts and this course will help me to make my plans come true.
